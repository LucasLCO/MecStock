### Strategy Pattern for Payment Processing

The MecStock application implements the Strategy Pattern for processing payments through different methods:

- **Core Concept**: Encapsulates different payment algorithms that can be selected at runtime
- **Implementation**: `/mecstock/backend/core/payments/strategies/`
- **Benefits**:
  - Enables pluggable payment methods (Cash, Credit Card, Debit Card, Bank Transfer, PIX)
  - Switching payment strategies during runtime without modifying client code
  - Easy extension with new payment methods without changing existing code

```python
# Example of Strategy Pattern Implementation
class PaymentService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategies = {
            'cash': CashPaymentStrategy(),
            'credit_card': CreditCardPaymentStrategy(),
            'debit_card': DebitCardPaymentStrategy(),
            'bank_transfer': BankTransferPaymentStrategy(),
            'pix': PixPaymentStrategy()
        }
    
    def process_payment(self, servico_id, payment_method, amount, **kwargs):
        if payment_method not in self.strategies:
            raise ValueError(f"Método de pagamento não suportado: {payment_method}")
            
        strategy = self.strategies[payment_method]
        return strategy.process_payment(amount, **kwargs)
